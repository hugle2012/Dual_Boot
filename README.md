How I Safely Quarantined My Windows OS (via Dual Boot with VHDX)

 This is just one method to dual-boot your computer using a VHDX (Virtual Hard Disk).

🔧 Step 1: Download the Windows ISO

Download the official ISO file from Microsoft:

👉 https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2156295

After downloading, mount the ISO.

 Step 2: Create a VHDX File
Right-click the Start Menu and select Disk Management

Go to Action → Create VHD

 Recommended options:

Format: VHDX

Type: Dynamically expanding

Size: At least 50GB

Location: Somewhere on a different partition (e.g., D:)

🖇️ Step 3: Mount and Apply the Windows Image

Find the version index using PowerShell (run as admin):

dism /Get-WimInfo /WimFile:E:\sources\install.esd

This will list all versions in the ISO.

I recommend using the same version as your current OS to avoid activation issues.

Apply the Windows image to the VHDX (replace E: and D: as needed):

Dism /Apply-Image /ImageFile:E:\sources\install.esd /Index:6 /ApplyDir:D:\

Step 4: Add to Boot Menu

After applying, run:

bcdboot D:\Windows

This will add your new Windows OS to the bootloader menu.

✅ Done!

You can now reboot your PC and select your "quarantined" Windows OS to run apps or tools without affecting your main system.
